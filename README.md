# Data Science in my everday life

Data Science has changed the way I look for answers in my daily life. 
Here are some analysis and projects I did that helped me to make better decisions.


## 1. Booking a international flight during the pandemic: reducing risks with an informed decision

**Problem/Motivation:** I needed to book a flight to Italy. Because of the pandemic, lots of flights were being canceled or rescheduled. Even though it was a particular uncertain period, I wanted to make an informed decision.

**Solution:** I decided to look at the historical data of biggest international airport in Brazil, Guarulhos - Sao Paulo. I looked for direct flights to and from Europe and searched for airlines and specific cities with more canceled and confirmed flights. The goal was to reduce the risk of last minute changes or cancelations by using historical data. 

**Conclusion:** The data showed that even with the pandemic ands its restrictions some airlines were still operating between Sao Paulo and some cities in Europe. The number of cancelations helped me to avoid specific airlines and destinations. The analysis also gave me more confidence and a better purchase experience.



## 2. Finding a place to live in Milan

**Problem/Motivation:** I needed to find a place to live in Milan. One of the options was to book a room directly from an agency. I wanted to understand if the price of the rooms I was picking were above or below the average and to find addresses with more than one room available.

**Solution:** I decided to scrape the agency's website to understand their offers better. Disclaimer: I collected this data for personal use only, and I took care to hide any of their data here and show just the aggregations from the analysis.

**Conclusion:** This analysis helped me to make a better decision about renting a room in Milan. I got a better view of the price range and what was been offered by the agency.
